CommonCrypto library rewritten and optimized for any version of Mac OS X.

* Current status:
- Added rewrite for most routines.
- Needs implementation of some cryptographics ciphers.
	- Needs implementation of some hashing algorithms.
	- Needs RSA cryptor code (mainly tie in to corecrypto parts or some other library).

The rest is currently done.
